## Introduction

<br>

In this Project I built a Honeynet & SOC Environment in **Microsoft Azure**.

I used **Log Analytics** to Ingest Logs from various sources into our Environment, then leveraged **Microsoft Sentinel** to Build Attack Maps, Trigger Alerts & Create Incidents.

I also Enabled **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** as a Data Source for the Log Analytics Workspace and to assess the Virtual Machines' Configurations relative to *Regulatory Frameworks & Security Controls*.

Following that, I configured Log Collection on the Insecure Environment, set Security Metrics and then observed the Environment for 24 hours.

After Investigating the Incidents that Microsoft Sentinel generated during that period, I incorporated Security Controls to address the Incidents and Harden our Environment, based on recommendations from **Microsoft Defender (*NIST 800-53*)**.

<details close> 
<summary> For the Post-Remediation phase of this Project and after a second 24-hour Observation Period, these were the Security Metrics collected:</summary>

- ```SecurityEvent``` ‚ûú Windows Event Logs

- ```Syslog``` ‚ûú Linux Event Logs

- ```SecurityAlert``` ‚ûú Log Analytics Alerts Triggered

- ```SecurityIncident``` ‚ûú Incidents created by Sentinel

- ```AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL``` ‚ûú  Malicious Flows allowed into our Honeynet

 <br />

<details close> 
<summary> <h3> üö´ BEFORE Hardening Measures & Security Controls:</h3> </summary>

- In the *BEFORE* stage of this Project ‚ûú all resources were initially deployed with Public Exposure to the Internet.

- This setup was Intentionally Insecure to Attract Potential Cyber Attackers and Observe their Tactics.
 
- The Virtual Machines had both their **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** and built-in **Firewalls** wide open, allowing Unrestricted Access from any source.

- Additionally, all other resources, such as **Storage Account**, **Key Vault** and **Databases**, were deployed with Public Endpoints visible to the internet, without utilizing any **Private Endpoints** for Added Security.

<br>

<details close> 
<summary> <h3> üîí AFTER Hardening Measures & Security Controls:</h3> </summary>

<br>

For the *AFTER* stage of this Project ‚ûú I implemented a series of **Hardening Measures & Security Control**s.

Th goal was to Improve the Environment's Overall **Security Posture**.

These improvements included:

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> ‚ù∂ Network Security Groups (NSGs)</h4> </summary>
 
 - I hardened the NSGs by blocking all inbound and outbound traffic, with the sole exception of my own public IP address.
 - This ensured that only authorized traffic from a trusted source was allowed to access the virtual machines.

   </details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> ‚ù∑ Built-in Firewalls</h4> </summary>

- I configured the built-in firewalls on the virtual machines to restrict access and protect the resources from unauthorized connections.
- This step involved fine-tuning the firewall rules based on the specific requirements of each VM, thereby minimizing the potential attack surface.

   </details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> ‚ù∏ Private Endpoints</h4> </summary>

- To enhance the security of other Azure resources, I replaced the public endpoints with Private Endpoints.
- This ensured that access to sensitive resources, such as storage accounts and databases, was limited to the virtual network and not exposed to the public internet.
- As a result, these resources were protected from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

<summary> <h2> üéØ Approach to Handling High-Priority Incidents with NIST Guidelines & Security Controls</h2> </summary>

<br>

For Effective Management of High-Priority Incidents:

1. I adhered to [NIST SP 800-61 Revision 2](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-sp-800-61) Guidelines.
2. Implemented Security Controls specified in [NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final).

<br>

**This Approach involved**:

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> Step 1Ô∏è‚É£</h4> </summary>
 
 - Initial Preparation ‚ûú Configuring a Log Analytics Workspace & Microsoft Sentinel.
 - Setting up Alerts for Incident Detection.
 - Implement NIST SP 800-53 Security Controls to ensure a Robust and Secure Environment.

</details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> Step 2Ô∏è‚É£</h4> </summary>
 
- When Incidents occurred, I Categorized and Assessed their Severity ‚ûú thoroughly investigating the different Logs to determine if the Incidents were False or True positives.
- My Incident Response Process was based on the NIST 800-61 guidelines.

</details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> Step 3Ô∏è‚É£</h4> </summary>
 
 - I also employed an Incident Response Playbook aligned with NIST 800-61 ‚ûú to document each Incident's details in a very comprehensive way.
 - The necessary Incident Response Activities were based on the Security Controls from NIST SP 800-53.

</details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> Step 4Ô∏è‚É£</h4> </summary>
 
 - For each Incident I documented all the post-resolution activities performed, what were the findings, the steps taken, and what my analyses was.
 - I Closed the Incident after highlighting what the resolution was and if there was any necessary follow-up actions required ‚ûú while ensuring Compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Security Controls.

## Conclusion

<br>

In this project, I set up a Honeynet and SOC Environment in **Microsoft Azure**, and integrated several Log Sources into a **Log Analytics Workspace**.
  
I used **Microsoft Sentinel** to Generate Alerts and Incidents based on the ingested Logs.
  
Furthermore, I assessed the Security Metrics in a initially Insecure Environment, *BEFORE* Implementing of Security Controls, and then *AFTER* doing so.
  
The substantial decrease in Security Events and Incidents Post-Implementation of **Security Measures** showcases how important they were in **fortifying our Cloud Environment**.
<br />
<br />

  <details close> 
  
**<summary> üí° Note</summary>**

It's important to note that if the network's resources were heavily utilized by regular users, there could have been a likelyhood of generating more security events and alerts in the 24-hour period following the implementation of security controls.
