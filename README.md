## Introduction

<br>

In this Project I built a Honeynet & SOC Environment in **Microsoft Azure**.

I used **Log Analytics** to Ingest Logs from various sources into our Environment, than leveraged **Microsoft Sentinel** to Build Attack Maps, Trigger Alerts & Create Incidents.

I also Enabled **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** as a Data Source for the Log Analytics Workspace and to assess the Virtual Machines' Configurations relative to *Regulatory Frameworks & Security Controls*.

Following that, I configured Log Collection on the Insecure Environment, set Security Metrics and then observed the Environment for 24 hours.

After Investigating the Incidents that Microsoft Sentinel generated during that period, I incorporated Security Controls to address the Incidents and Harden our Environment, based on recommendations from **Microsoft Defender (*NIST 800-53*)**.

<details close> 
<summary> For the Post-Remediation phase of this Project and after a second 24-hour Observation Period, these were the Metrics collected:</summary>

- ```SecurityEven``` ‚ûú Windows Event Logs

- ```Syslog``` ‚ûú Linux Event Logs

- ```SecurityAlert``` ‚ûú Log Analytics Alerts Triggered

- ```SecurityIncident``` ‚ûú Incidents created by Sentinel

- ```AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL``` ‚ûú  Malicious Flows allowed into our Honeynet

 <br />

<details close> 
<summary> <h3> üö´ BEFORE Hardening Measures & Security Controls:</h3> </summary>

- In the *BEFORE* stage of this Project ‚ûú all resources were initially deployed with Public Exposure to the Internet.

- This setup was Intentionally Insecure to Attract Potential Cyber Attackers and Observe their Tactics.
 
- The Virtual Machines had both their **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** and built-in **Firewalls** wide open, allowing Unrestricted Access from any source.

- Additionally, all other resources, such as **Storage Account**, **Key Vault** and **Databases**, were deployed with Public Endpoints visible to the internet, without utilizing any **Private Endpoints** for Added Security.

  </details>

<br>

## Architecture *AFTER* Implementing Hardening Measures and Security Controls

<br>

<details close> 
<summary> <h3> üîí AFTER Hardening Measures & Security Controls:</h3> </summary>

<br>

For the *AFTER* stage of this Project ‚ûú I implemented a series of **Hardening Measures & Security Control**s.

Th goal was to Improve the Environment's Overall **Security Posture**.

These improvements included:

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> ‚ù∂ Network Security Groups (NSGs)</h4> </summary>
 
 - I hardened the NSGs by blocking all inbound and outbound traffic, with the sole exception of my own public IP address.
 - This ensured that only authorized traffic from a trusted source was allowed to access the virtual machines.

   </details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> ‚ù∑ Built-in Firewalls</h4> </summary>

- I configured the built-in firewalls on the virtual machines to restrict access and protect the resources from unauthorized connections.
- This step involved fine-tuning the firewall rules based on the specific requirements of each VM, thereby minimizing the potential attack surface.

   </details>

<details close> 
<summary> <h4> ‚ù∏ Private Endpoints</h4> </summary>

- To enhance the security of other Azure resources, I replaced the public endpoints with Private Endpoints.
- This ensured that access to sensitive resources, such as storage accounts and databases, was limited to the virtual network and not exposed to the public internet.
- As a result, these resources were protected from unauthorized access and potential attacks.

   </details>

  </details>

<br>

<h3>üìà Result:</h3>
 
By comparing the **Security Metrics** *BEFORE* and *AFTER* implementing these **Hardening Measures** & **Security Controls**:

‚úÖ I was able to demonstrate the Effectiveness of each step in improving the overall **Security Posture** of the **Azure Environment**.

## Attack Maps BEFORE Hardening Measures and Security Controls

### ‚û°Ô∏è NSG Allowed Malicious Inbound Flows

This attack map demonstrates the consequences of leaving the **Network Security Group (NSG)** open, as it allowed for Malicious Traffic to flow unimpeded.

This visualization underscores the importance of implementing proper Security Measures, such as **Restricting NSG Rules**, to Prevent Unauthorized Access and Minimize Potential Threats.

<br>

### ‚û°Ô∏è Linux SSH Authentication Failures
 
This attack map highlights the numerous **Syslog Authentication Failures** experienced by the **Linux Server** I deployed, indicating that unauthorized access attempts were made from outisde.

This serves as a reminder of the importance of securing Linux servers with **Strong Authentication Mechanisms** and **Monitoring System Logs** for signs of intrusion attempts.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Windows RDP/SMB Authentication Failures
 
This Attack Map showcases numerous **RDP and SMB Failures**, illustrating the persistent attempts by potential attackers to exploit these protocols.

The visualization emphasizes the need for **Securing Remote Access** and **File Sharing Services** to protect against unauthorized access and potential cyber threats.</b>

<br>

## Attack Maps AFTER Hardening Measures and Security Controls

<br>

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

<br />
<br />
<br />

 
## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

<br>

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
- Start Time: 2024-06-02 17:02:00 PM
- Stop Time: 2024-06-03 17:02:00 PM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent (Windows VM)            | 21182
| Syslog (Linux VM)                   | 4877
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud            | 0
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)        | 343
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed | 969

<br />
<br />


## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

<br>

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
- Start Time: 2024-06-18 15:37
- Stop Time:	2024-06-19 15:37


| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent (Windows VM)            | 783
| Syslog (Linux VM)                   | 23
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud            | 0
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)        | 0
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed | 0

<br />
<br />
 
## Approach to Handling High-Priority Incidents with NIST Guidelines and Security Controls

<br>

For effective management of high-priority incidents I:

1. Adhered to **NIST 800-61 (Revision 2) Guidelines**.<br />
2. Implemented Security Controls specified in **NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 5)**.

<br>

The approach involved:

- Initiating preparations by establishing a log analytics workspace, configuring Azure Sentinel, and setting up alerts for incident detection. The implementation of NIST SP 800-53 security controls ensured a robust and secure environment.

- When incidents occurred, I categorized and assessed their severity, conducting thorough investigations into logs to distinguish false from true positives. The incident response procedures outlined in NIST 800-61 (Revision 2) guided this process, evaluating the scope of impact.
 
- To streamline incident response, I employed an incident response playbook aligned with NIST 800-61 (Revision 2), documenting incident details comprehensively. Relevant security controls from NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 5) guided the execution of incident response activities.
  
- Post-resolution, meticulous documentation of findings, steps taken, and analyses performed was undertaken for each incident. Closure involved indicating the resolution and any necessary follow-up actions while ensuring compliance with NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 5) security controls.

<br />
<br />
 
 
## Conclusion

<br>

In this project, a small-scale honeynet was set up in **Microsoft Azure**, and log sources were integrated into a **Log Analytics Workspace**.
  
**Microsoft Sentine**l was utilized to generate alerts and incidents based on the processed logs.
  
Furthermore, metrics were assessed in the initially insecure environment, both before and after the implementation of security controls.
  
The substantial decrease in security events and incidents post the application of security measures underscores their efficacy in fortifying the environment.

**<summary> üí° Note</summary>**

It's important to note that if the network's resources were heavily utilized by regular users, there could have been a likelyhood of generating more security events and alerts in the 24-hour period following the implementation of security controls.
